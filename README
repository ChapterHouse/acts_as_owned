ActsAsOwned
===========

The ActsAsOwned plugin allows for associating objects with users, verifying this association, and
automatically setting the default scope to find according to the current logged in user.

Requirements
============
Rails 2.3 or later
restful_authentication plugin

Example
=======

Assuming that you could some how access the current logged in user at the model level,
you could write something like this for your class.

   class OwnedItem < ActiveRecord::Base
     
     default_scope :conditions => {:user_id => current_user ? current_user.id : nil}
     belongs_to :user
     validates_presence_of :user
     validates_associated :user
     before_validation_on_create, Proc.new { |record| record.user = current_user }
     
   end

Some of this could also be handled in the controller. Specifically the association of the current user
with the record and the scoping of the finds. However, instead of doing all of this, you could just use

   class OwnedItem < ActiveRecord::Base
     acts_as_owned
   end

Short sweet and to the point.
